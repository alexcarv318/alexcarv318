- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexcarv318
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m keep on diving deep into development, focusing primarily on Python with aspirations to explore other programming languages. Transitioning towards becoming a full-stack developer, I am particularly eager to enhance my JavaScript and markup skills, given my strong inclination towards web development. Moreover, I'm intrigued by emerging technologies and seek to venture into the realm of machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm immersed in mastering developer skills while actively contributing to the growth of a dynamic startup environment.
- ðŸ’¼ As an individual already immersed in a professional environment, I'm actively seeking opportunities in companies where I can further enrich my commercial experience, collaborate within a team, refine my skills, and tackle engaging business challenges.
