- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexcarv318
- 👀 I’m interested in learning development in depth, in Python and in the future in other programming languages. I would also like to become a full-stack developer, so I'm interested in developing my JavaScript skills and markup skills, because my main focus is web development. But I am interested in learning new technologies, so I also want to develop in the direction of machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python's OOP, Python's web-parsing, SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on company where I can gain commercial experience, work in a team, hone my skills and complete interesting business tasks
